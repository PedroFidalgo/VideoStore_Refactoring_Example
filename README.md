This is an example of basic refactoring steps to achive a higher cohesion supported by tests.
The refactoring steps coincide with each commit.

Requirements:
 - Maven
 - JDK 1.8

To execute the tests:  
Run 'mvn clean compile test' on the project root folder.

To execute the App.java:  
Run 'mvn clean compile exec:java' on the project root folder.
